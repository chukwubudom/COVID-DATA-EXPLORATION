# COVID-DATA-EXPLORATION
## Dataset

> The dataset used in this exploration was gotten from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) records, which contains information about testing, hospitalizations, deaths, vaccinations and more on the Coronavirus Pandemic for individual countries. This exploration covered the period from January 2020 to October 2021

### Exploration Details 

> To uncover insights from the larget dataset in SQL, I wrote queries that returned answers to the following:
> * Comparison of total cases and total deaths for the period under review
> * Explored the likelihood of recording a death for individual countries over a given time
> * Compared total cases to the population and extracted the percentage of the population infected at a given time, for a specific country
> * Countries with the highest infection rates compared to the population
> * What is the death rate per population?
> * What is the death rate by continent?
> Join of the deaths table and vaccinations table for insights into the impact of vaccination on death
> * What is the total vaccination by location 
> Used CTE to perform calculation on partitions of the data 
> Used temp tables to perform calculations on partitions of the data
> Created a view to store data for visualization in Tableau
